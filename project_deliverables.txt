Scraping: 
Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape real estate listings from websites 
like Zillow or Realtor.

Clean and store the data in a SQL database (SQLite for simplicity or 
PostgreSQL for a more realistic experience).

Clean the scraped data, analyze property prices, trends, and visualize 
data (e.g., price distributions, location-based analysis) using Pandas 
and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Analyze housing affordability by region, income levels, and demographic 
factors, and visualize trends and disparities.
